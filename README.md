# Dynamic Range-Based Market Analysis Viewer

Advanced implementation with dynamic bullish/bearish range tracking, structural pivot identification, and sophisticated high/low updating rules.

## Overview

This tool implements a complex range-based algorithm that goes far beyond simple pullback identification. It creates a sophisticated dynamic range tracking system with intelligent state management and conservative body-based validation.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Range State Management
- **Bullish/Bearish Range Assignment**: Market momentum assessment assigns persistent range states
- **State Persistence**: Ranges continue until broken by significant directional moves
- **Body-Based Validation**: Uses candle bodies (not wicks) for conservative sentiment analysis

### ðŸ“Š Structural Pivot Identification
- **Confirmed Highs/Lows**: Identifies pivots with confirmation on both sides
- **Configurable Lookback**: Adjustable confirmation period (default: 3 candles)
- **Visual Markers**: Orange triangles for structural highs, purple for structural lows

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic High/Low Tracking
- **Intelligent Updates**: Range highs/lows update only under specific conditions
- **Last Major Movement Logic**: Tracks "sell before buy" and "buy before sell" patterns
- **Conservative Approach**: Body-based validation prevents false signals

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Visualization
- **Dynamic Range Lines**: Blue line for range highs, red line for range lows
- **State Change Indicators**: Arrows showing bullish/bearish range transitions
- **Structural Pivots**: Clear marking of confirmed pivot points
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles high-frequency data efficiently

## Algorithm Details

### Range State Logic

**Bullish Range Assignment:**
- Triggered when candle body closes above previous candle high
- Continues updating high until body exceeds current high
- Low determined by finding lowest point after last "sell before buy"
- Range persists until bearish break occurs

**Bearish Range Assignment:**
- Triggered when candle body closes below previous candle low  
- Continues updating low until body goes below current low
- High determined by finding highest point after last "buy before sell"
- Range persists until bullish break occurs

### High/Low Update Rules

**In Bullish Ranges:**
- High updates only when candle body (open or close) exceeds current high
- When high updates, low recalculates based on last major sell signal
- Provides dynamic support/resistance levels

**In Bearish Ranges:**
- Low updates only when candle body (open or close) goes below current low
- When low updates, high recalculates based on last major buy signal
- Maintains relevant range boundaries

### Structural Pivot Detection

**Structural High:**
- Higher than all surrounding highs within lookback period
- Confirmed on both left and right sides
- Represents significant resistance levels

**Structural Low:**
- Lower than all surrounding lows within lookback period
- Confirmed on both left and right sides
- Represents significant support levels

## Advanced Features

### Body-Based Validation
Unlike traditional technical analysis that uses wicks, this implementation focuses on candle bodies for more conservative and accurate sentiment analysis.

### Dynamic Range Recalculation
Ranges aren't static - they dynamically adjust based on market behavior, providing always-current support and resistance levels.

### Momentum Assessment
The algorithm assesses market momentum to assign range states, ensuring alignment with actual market direction.

### Conservative Approach
By requiring body-based validation and confirmed structural pivots, the system reduces false signals and provides more reliable analysis.

## Comparison with Simple Pullback Analysis

| Feature | Simple Pullbacks | Dynamic Range Analysis |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| State Management | None | Bullish/Bearish ranges |
| High/Low Logic | Static points | Dynamic updating rules |
| Validation | Wick-based | Body-based conservative |
| Structural Analysis | Basic | Confirmed pivots |
| Range Tracking | None | Continuous range management |
| Market Context | Limited | Full momentum assessment |

## Use Cases

### Day Trading
- Identify current range state for directional bias
- Use dynamic support/resistance for entries/exits
- Monitor structural pivots for key levels

### Swing Trading
